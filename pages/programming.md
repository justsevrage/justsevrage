# Programming

Ever since I was little, I was attracted to programming.
There is just something that makes me happy
when I create something.

> Fun fact! The page you are seeing right now was made
using a [custom framework](https://github.com/notangelmario/notangelmario) built in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

## When it started...

I used to program in [batch script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file),
way way back when I was about 13. I knew all the tricks to get around
batch limitations. My first program was a toy hacking framework.
Unfortunately I can't seem to find the source code anymore. :(

## What do I do now?

I love to code in:

* TypeScript
* JavaScript
* C
* Rust
* Python

I mainly focus on the web side of programming. I love web technology,
and I believe in the future of **web apps**.

I also love **open source**. Ever since I found out about Linux and
the open source community, I felt that this is the best way
that software can evolve.

## My projects

I've had quite a few projects. Here are a few:

Some other highlights:

* [markdownc](https://github.com/notangelmario/markdownc)
* [mdserve](https://deno.land/x/mdserve)
* [pico-w-morse-code](https://github.com/notangelmario/pico-w-morse-code)
* [Vibrant](https://github.com/notangelmario/vibrant)

## My toolchain

I use a Lenovo Chromebook Duet as my primary computer and also
a desktop PC as a secondary computer. I am always on the go, so
the chromebook gets to be my primary device.

Here are the things that I use in my programming workflow:

* [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
* [zsh](https://zsh.org)
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io)
* [Marker](https://marker.fructo.land)
* [markdownc](https://github.com/notangelmario/markdownc)

I heavily use **Markdown** as my "document language". I love making
documents in Markdown because it's fast. Also easy to convert
to other formats.
