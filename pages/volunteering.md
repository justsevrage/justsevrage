# Volunteering

Volunteering makes up a big part of what I am, and helped me evolve.

As of now, I have participated in multiple projects such as:
* Tineri pentru TINEri
* Planetise
* Lots and lots of Eramsus+ and ESC projects

I own 3 youthpasses and have travelled to:

* Istanbul, Turkey
* Ankara, Turkey
* Sinaia, Romania
* Numerous visits in Bucharest

## How it started

I started volunteering back in high school when I found out
about this concept. Before then, I wasn't really interested
but now, I love it. Youth exchanges are my favourites,
I love being the host and the guest of such projects
