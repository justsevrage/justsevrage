# Art & Music

I always loved music and art so I decided to get into
the art of making them.

## Music

I am a self-taught guitar player. I picked up a guitar
and instantly started going at it. With patience and
practice I got good enough to play almost any song I can
think of.

My first song was [Nebun de Alb by Emeric Imre](https://open.spotify.com/track/0PV1q5CrunztEgR6xQcDwt).
Not a easy song for a beginner. But with trial and error
I finally got good enough to play it in any way I want.

## Art

I always had a love for pastel colors and minimalist, abstract
art and [surrealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism).

Here are a few of my artworks:
