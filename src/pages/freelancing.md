## What can I build?

You can hire me to build (in order which ones I know best):
* Websites;
* SPA web apps;
* SSR web apps;
* APIs;
* Libraries;
* Custom tools;
* Mobile applications;
* Desktop applications;
* CLI tools;

## What do you get?

When you hire me, you get:
* A professional, responsive, and reliable developer;
* A developer who is passionate about their work;
* A very careful developer who isn't afraid to use new technologies;
* A developer who is willing to use new technologies as long as they are the best fit for the project and team;
* A careful selection based on the needs of the project;

I love new technologies that are well-suited for the project and team, but I make thorough research to ensure that they are sustainable, reliable, stable and secure.

## Why hire me?

You should hire me in case I fit your needs, I will not stretch myself to fit your needs, but since I have a wide range of skills, you might find that I am a good fit for your project. Here are some reasons why you should hire me:

* Based on your project's budget, you might find it more cost-effective to hire me for a one-time project than to hire a full-time developer;
* You might also be interested in simply consulting me for advice on your project, I will be happy to help you with that;
* I am a careful developer that will not rush into a project without understanding the requirements and the needs of the project;
* New technologies are cool, but I will only use them if they are stable enough and fit the project best in the long term;
* While you are the client and ultimately decide what is best for your project, I will always give you my honest opinion on what is best for your project. I will always be honest about the project's status and the technologies used;
* After the project is finished, I will be happy to help you with any questions you might have about the project, even if it is not related to the project itself;
* The source code of the project will be available to you, so you can modify it as you see fit. Optionally, I can also provide documentation on how to modify the project;

## Pricing

I charge per project, not per hour. The price of the project will depend on the complexity of the project and the estimated time to complete it. I will provide you with a quote before starting the project.

I usually charge 50% upfront and 50% after the project is finished, but I am open to other payment methods.

Previous clients have been satisfied with my work, and found it to be cost-effective and reliable.
