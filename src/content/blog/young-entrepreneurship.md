I recently went on a youth exchange in Costinesti, Romania. This youth exchange
was about young entrepreneurship. It helped us manage our emotions, build a
business and work together in a team. This [ERASMUS+](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/)
project is possibly the best project I've been to.

In this youth exchange there were 5 countries. Greece, Spain, Turkey, Italy
and Romania. We were the host country. This project lasted 10 beautiful days
where we were together for the same goal. To learn about entrepreneurship and
team building.

## About Paquet, the fictional company

[Paquet](https://paquet.app), one of my projects, won the contest as the best
company. Paquet was the product and Paquet LLC was the fictional company.

Here are the people that helped me achieve this dream.

I was helped by **Lara**, **Gabriela**, **Aleyna**, **Sultan** and **Stefanos**.
Our team was composed of spanish, romanian, turkish and greek team members.

### Our presentations

We kept our presentation simple and product focused. No fuss
about how the entire company works. People are focused on the
product, not the company.

That's why our presentations were just 2 minutes long and talked about everything
that needed to be said.

### Our business plan

Our business was very thorough so the reader could understand as much as possible about
Paquet, the company, and Paquet, the product.

## About the contest

In the contest there were some very interesting and potentially successful. One
of the entries were **Food Match**. An app that connects the consumer and
individual sellers. This entry had the best presentation and, to be honest, the
most potential.

Another interesting entry was **Tradeed**. An app that lets you trade skills.
You learn about something by teaching something else. In my opinion
it had the greatest marketing, with merch, commercials and others.

A great entry was also **Cutie**. "Cutie" is the romanian word for box. A very
good word play. This entry was about delivering ingredients for making
cocktails and other drinks at home. This entry had simply the best moto. "Mix
up your nights" impressed everyone since it was simple, creative and overall
the coolest.

**Mercurius** was a cool concept but flawed. It was targeted at teaching
middle eastern countries english. The main consumers were people who already
knew english, but wanted

## Lions by day, lions by night

Days were filled with tasks and games and nights were filled with dance and
music. We all managed to party as hard as we worked. I thought that was
amazing. To see someone who was a party animal last night, make a very serious
business presentation is quite amazing.

## Cultural nights

The cultural nights were one of the best. From Spain to Italy, from
Turkey to Greece, all nights were filled with great parties and presentations
about culture, language and traditions.

We learned so much about each others countries and we realised how different we
were yet so similar. Personally, the turkish culture night was my favourite,
as we found out about traditional food, cool facts, insights into the country's
past and future and so much more. Turkey always had a special place in my heart
either way. Oh, by the way, [it seems it's Turkiye and not Turkey anymore](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/03/turkey-changes-name-to-turkiye-as-other-name-is-for-the-birds).

The romanian culture night was hosted on the 1st of December as it was
our national day. At the same hotel where we were, was another youth exchange
project. So we decided to unite and make the greatest culture night of all times.
This cultural night took place in 2 different places and had multiple shows.
We had lots of food, drinks and dances. Overall the biggest cultural night.

## Secret Garden Talks

In the hotel there was a secret garden, an area where we could sit down
and talk. In every talk I would put some ambient music to relax everybody
after working on their tasks and companies. I made a playlist of all the
songs that I played in the background.

## More

This youth exchange was not just about making a business. This project helped
us work in a team, control our emotions, understand certain concepts about
entrepreneurship, volunteering and more.

In this project I learned how to be a better leader. I learned how distribute
the work to everybody equally and also by their knowledge and skills.

I also learned more on the emotional side of things. I have learned that
people come and go. But experiences, and the changes that they make in you
stays. The departure and the last goodbyes were pretty rough emotionally.

I also aknowledged my obsession to always take responsability in everything.
Now I am trying to slowly let this obsession go. If keep taking responsability
in everything I am going to burn myself out.

On the more personal side of things, I learned that it's ok to take time to
think about everything that happens around you. Sometimes you need some time
to process the things that are happening around you. If you don't you are
going to be left out confused and emotionally unstable.

I want to thank all the participants in this project that helped me grow more
as a person. And also, I want to thank [ODES Association](https://www.facebook.com/odesa.ngo)
for making this project possible.
