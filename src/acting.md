# Acting

I got the amazing oportunity to be an actor. I sided with
[Politeia](http://politeia.ro/), an educational NGO,
and performed in 6 high schools in Bucharest, one of which
[Gheorghe Lazar National Collage](https://cnlazar.ro/).

I had a great time on stage and it really helped me
be more confident. I got to perform next to wonderful people
and got to understand the bullying concept better and
what we can do both as a victim and as a bystander.
