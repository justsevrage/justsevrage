# Am I prepared to make a company?

> Published on 20.11.2022

So I took down yet another startup. [Fructoland](https://fructo.land) was 
a project that aimed to make good software for minimalists using
cutting edge web tech.

We had a pretty good start, but then we stumbled on some
legal problems, so I had to shut it down.

## It's not the first time though

I also had a delivery company called Pingy. We got into
some problems with the local restaurants and we again
were forced to shutdown the project.

## Fail fast or win big

As the Silicon Valley says: fail fast or win big. I guess
it's a good thing to try as many things as possible.
This way you can find something that sticks. Something
that you like and that you can profit from.

## So what does it take?

Well, it takes money, a good idea and a good team.
I learned that it's better when you have someone
to help you.

I guess it's lesson learned. I will apply this knowledge
in the future.

## It's sad though

It's so unfortunate though that I had to do this.
But I have bigger things planned though. Maybe
Fructoland will be revived.
